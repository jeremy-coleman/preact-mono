### Installation

> **Important**: [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) > V6.x is a minimum requirement.

```sh
$ npm install -g preact-cli
```

### Usage

```sh
$ preact create <template-name> <project-name>
```

Example:

```sh
$ preact create default my-project
```

The above command pulls the template from [preactjs-templates/default], prompts for some information, and generates the project at `./my-project/`.

### Official Templates

The purpose of official preact project templates are to provide opinionated development tooling setups so that users can get started with actual app code as fast as possible. However, these templates are un-opinionated in terms of how you structure your app code and what libraries you use in addition to preact.js.

All official project templates are repos in the [preactjs-templates organization]. When a new template is added to the organization, you will be able to run `preact create <template-name> <project-name>` to use that template.

Current available templates include:

- [default] - Default template with all features.

- [material] - material template using preact-material-components

- [simple] - The simplest possible preact setup in a single file

- [widget] - Template for a widget to be embedded in another website.

> üíÅ Tip: Any Github repo with a `'template'` folder can be used as a custom template: <br /> `preact create <username>/<repository> <project-name>`

### CLI Options

#### preact create

Create a project to quick start development.

```sh
$ preact create <template-name> <project-name>

  --name        The application name.

#### preact list

Lists all the official preactjs-cli repositories

```sh
$ preact list
```

### Deploying

```sh
# create a production build:
npm run build

# generate configuration in Firebase Hosting format:
npm run serve -- --server config

# Copy your static files to a server!
```

### Pre-rendering

Preact CLI in order to follow [PRPL] pattern renders initial route (`/`) into generated static `index.html` - this ensures that users get to see your page before any JavaScript is run, and thus providing users with slow devices or poor connection your website's content much faster.

Preact CLI does this by rendering your app inside node - this means that we don't have access to DOM or other global variables available in browsers, similar how it would be in server-side rendering scenarios. In case you need to rely on browser APIs you could:

- drop out of prerendering by passing `--no-prerender` flag to `preact build`,
- write your code in a way that supports server-side rendering by wrapping code that requires browser's APIs in conditional statements `if (typeof window !== "undefined") { ... }` ensuring that on server those lines of code are never reached. Alternatively you could use a helper library like [window-or-global](https://www.npmjs.com/package/window-or-global).

### Custom Configuration

#### Plugins

To make customizing your configuration easier, preact-cli supports plugins. Visit the [Plugins wiki] for a tutorial on how to use them.

#### Browserslist

You may customize your list of supported browser versions by declaring a [`"browserslist"`] key within your `package.json`. Changing these values will modify your JavaScript (via [`babel-preset-env`]) and your CSS (via [`autoprefixer`](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)) output.

By default, `preact-cli` emulates the following config:

> `package.json`

```json
{
	"browserslist": ["> 1%", "IE >= 9", "last 2 versions"]
}
```

#### Babel

To customize Babel, you have two options:

1. You may create a [`.babelrc`] file in your project's root directory. Any settings you define here will overwrite matching config-keys within [Preact CLI preset]. For example, if you pass a `"plugins"` object, it will replace & reset all Babel plugins that Preact CLI defaults to.

2. If you'd like to modify or add to the existing Babel config, you must use a `preact.config.js` file. Visit the [Webpack](#webpack) section for more info, or check out the [Customize Babel] example!

#### Webpack

To customize preact-cli create a `preact.config.js` or a `preact.config.json` file.

> `preact.config.js`

```js
// ... imports or other code up here ...

// these props are both optional
export default {
	// you can add preact-cli plugins here
	plugins: [
		// either a function
		// (you'd probably import this because you can use the `webpack` function instead of an inline plugin)
		function() {},
		// strings also work (they get imported by preact-cli), useful for the json config
		'plugin-name',
		// with options
		[
			'plugin-name',
			{
				option: true,
			},
		],
	],
	/**
	 * Function that mutates the original webpack config.
	 * Supports asynchronous changes when a promise is returned (or it's an async function).
	 *
	 * @param {object} config - original webpack config.
	 * @param {object} env - options passed to the CLI.
	 * @param {WebpackConfigHelpers} helpers - object with useful helpers for working with the webpack config.
	 * @param {object} options - this is mainly relevant for plugins (will always be empty in the config), default to an empty object
	 **/
	webpack(config, env, helpers, options) {
		/** you can change the config here **/
	},
};
```

See [WebpackConfigHelpers] docs for more info on `helpers` argument which contains methods to find various parts of configuration. Additionally see our [recipes wiki] containing examples on how to change webpack configuration.

#### Prerender multiple routes

The `--prerender` flag will prerender by default only the root of your application.
If you want to prerender other routes you can create a `prerender-urls.json` file, which contains the set of routes you want to render.
The format required for defining your routes is an array of objects with a `url` key and an optional `title` key.

> `prerender-urls.json`

```json
[
	{
		"url": "/",
		"title": "Homepage"
	},
	{
		"url": "/route/random"
	}
]
```

You can customise the path and/or name of `prerender-urls.json` by using the flag `--prerenderUrls`.

```sh
preact build --prerenderUrls src/prerender-urls.json
```

If a static JSON file is too restrictive, you may want to provide a javascript file that exports your routes instead.
Routes can be exported as a JSON string or an object and can optionally be returned from a function.

```js
// prerender-urls.js
module.exports = [
	{
		url: '/',
		title: 'Homepage',
	},
	{
		url: '/route/random',
	},
];
```

#### Template

A template is used to render your page.

The default one is visible [here](src/resources/template.html) and it's going to be enough for the majority of cases.

If you want to customise your template you can pass a custom template with the `--template` flag.

The `--template` flag is available on the `build` and `watch` commands.

```sh
preact build --template src/template.html
preact watch --template src/template.html
```
